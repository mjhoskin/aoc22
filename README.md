Occasional python / bash data process methods in `procs`. Might require `sudo chmod +x procs/xxx.sh` to allow it to run directly. 

All proc scripts look for a file of the form `dayN.txt` in `/data/` and writes to 
the same file name in `/out_data`. The output folder might need to be manually 
created with e.g. `mkdir out_data`. 

`tg_exports` contains the autogenerated loading job code.
